SolarPunk Protocol is a DePIN + ReFi infrastructure on Solana that turns LGRlight into on-chain truth. We capture solar energy data via IoT devices, mint kWh-backed tokens on Solana, and create a new paradigm for decentralized energy ownership. Our protocol enables anyone to tokenize their renewable energy production and participate in the green economy revolution.



SolarPunk Protocol — Presentation

Here’s the problem: many rooftop and community solar systems produce excess electricity that can’t legally be sold to the grid without permits. That means clean energy often gets wasted or confined to self-use. Owners have no easy, compliant way to convert surplus power into income.

Our team mixes IoT engineers, energy monitoring experts, and Solana builders. We’ve shipped datalogger integrations, built power-quality analytics for solar farms, and written production Solana programs. We know both the physical energy layer and the blockchain layer.

1 — Title & Vision

SolarPunk Protocol
Decentralized Energy, Tokenized Sunshine

We make sunlight real — on-chain.

A Solana-based DePIN + ReFi infrastructure protocol
that transforms real-world solar energy into verifiable, tradable digital assets.

⸻

2 — The Problem
	•	Energy production today is highly centralized and opaque
	•	Solar energy data is locked inside corporate or institutional systems
	•	Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are expensive, slow to settle, and hard to verify
	•	Individual producers cannot prove or monetize their energy generation

⸻

3 — The Solution

SolarPunk Protocol enables decentralized verification and tokenization of solar generation data:
	1.	IoT + Solana Infrastructure: Data loggers upload generation data via MQTT/HTTP → Solana RPC → On-chain Proof of Energy Production (PoEP).
	2.	Tokenization Layer: Each 1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 1 $LGR token (configurable ratio).
	3.	ReFi Module: $LGR can be staked, traded, or redeemed for carbon credit assets.
	4.	Open Protocol: Developers and energy communities can integrate via API / SDK.

Stack:
	•	Backend: Node.js / Express / MQTT
	•	On-chain: Solana + Anchor (Rust)
	•	Frontend: React + Wallet Adapter
	•	Data Proof: IoT-signed payloads + timestamp verification

5 — Tokenomics (ReFi Layer)

Action	On-chain Effect	Reward
Generate Solar Energy	Mint $LGR	Energy Income
Stake $LGR	Earn $ECO	Green Incentive
Burn $LGR	Mint Carbon Credit NFT	Sustainability Proof

Goal: Build a decentralized green financial system —
where sustainability itself becomes profitable.

⸻

6 — Why Solana
	•	High throughput for real-time IoT energy data writes
	•	Low gas cost → supports micro energy transactions
	•	Active DePIN and ReFi ecosystem (Helium, Render, Hivemapper)
	•	Mature infrastructure (RPC services, indexers, wallet support)

Energy on-chain requires speed, transparency, and composability — Solana has all three.

⸻

7 — Use Cases
	•	Home solar producers earn $LGR rewards
	•	Enterprises verify green energy data for ESG reporting
	•	Carbon credit markets track and trade $LGR-based assets
	•	Governments/NGOs incentivize clean energy generation

8 — Roadmap

2025 Q1: MVP Prototype — Data Logger → Solana → Dashboard
2025 Q2: Public Testnet + ReFi Liquidity Pool Integration
2025 Q3: Partnerships with Solar Hardware Manufacturers
2025 Q4: Mainnet Launch + DAO Governance (SolarDAO)

9 — The Cypherpunk Manifesto

In a world where energy is monopolized and ecosystems are destroyed,
we choose to rewrite the rules of energy ownership.

Every watt of power should belong to its creator —
whether it’s a rooftop worker, a desert array, or a sun-chasing engineer.

We are not just writing code — we are designing the future of energy freedom.
The revolution will not be centralized; it will be ignited by sunlight.

10 — Call to Action

Join the SolarPunk Movement.
Let open-source energy belong to everyone.

Building a solar economy, starting from a ray of sunlight.
