SolarPunk Protocol is a DePIN + ReFi infrastructure on Solana that turns sunlight into on-chain truth. We capture solar energy data via IoT devices, mint kWh-backed tokens on Solana, and create a new paradigm for decentralized energy ownership. Our protocol enables anyone to tokenize their renewable energy production and participate in the green economy revolution.
